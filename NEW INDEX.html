	<b><u>Book 1: THE LION BY John Legend</u><br/></b> <h3>In a dense forest, lived a fierce lion. He was very cruel. One day the lion was caught in a hunter’s trap. One by one many animals passed by. “Please helped me!" pleaded the lion. But none of the animals listened to his plea. 

After a while, a man happened to come into the forest. He saw the lion. The lion said, “I will die of hunger and suffocation. Please help me out, O! kind man." The man was thoughtful. “I assure you I will never harm you. Please help me now. The hunter will be anytime now," said the lion. 

The man felt sorry for the lion and set the beast free. As soon as the lion was free, he let out a fierce roar. “I have been trapped in the cage for a long time. I am hungry. I will have to eat you," said the lion, looking at the man. “But you promised that you would not harm me," said the man, in a meek tone. “Yes, I said that. But only to convince you to free me. Now, I am terribly hungry," said the lion. 

The terrified man thought quickly. He said, “Alright, you can eat me. But let a judge decide if you are right in eating the person who has rescued you." 

The lion agreed. He was sure that no animal would speak against him. Just then a jackal came that way and the lion asked the jackal to be the judge. He addressed the lion, “Sir, would you please show me how it all happened?" The lion was only too willing. He entered the cage and closed the cage door. The jackal immediately bolted the cage from outside. 

“Now the lion is trapped again. Run away, you foolish man! And never offer help to anyone without thinking," said the jackal. The frightened man ran for his life. And the ungrateful lion was trapped in the cage again. The hunter came and took the lion away to his circus. </h3><br/>

	<b><u>Book 2: LOVE BY Paulo Coelho</u></b> <br/><h3>Love Story is a 1970 romance novel by American writer Erich Segal. The book's origins lay in a screenplay that Segal wrote, and that was subsequently approved for production by Paramount Pictures. Paramount requested that Segal adapt the story into novel form as a preview of sorts for the film. The novel was released on February 14, 1970, Valentine's Day. Portions of the story originally appeared in The Ladies' Home Journal.[1][clarification needed] Love Story became the top-selling work of fiction for all of 1970 in the United States, and was translated into more than 20 languages. The novel stayed for 41 weeks in The New York Times Best Seller list, reaching the top spot. A sequel, Oliver's Story, was published in 1977. A film adaptation was released on December 16, 1970.</h3>
